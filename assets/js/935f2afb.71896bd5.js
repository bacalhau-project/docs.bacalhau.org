StyleGAN is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which includes a generator and discriminator network that has been trained to differentiate images generated by generator from real images. However, during the training the generator tries to fool the discriminator, which results in the generatation of realistic looking images. With StyleGAN3 we can generate realistic looking images or videos. It can generate not only human faces, but also animals, cars and landscapes.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"examples/model-training/index":{"id":"examples/model-training/index","title":"Model
