# FAQs

### How can I pull several pieces of data from several IPFS CIDs? 

You can use the `--input-volumes` or `-v` flag multiple times with multiple different CIDs, and give each of them a path to be mounted at. 
For example, doing `bacalhau run cat/main.wasm -v CID1:/input1 -v CID2:/input2` will result in both the `input1` and `input2` folders being available to your running WASM with the CID contents. You can use `-v` as many times as you need. 

### How can I submit Job requests through CLI to communicate with my Node directly?

To ensure the CLI can communicate with our node directly (i.e. `bacalhau --api-host <MY_NODE_PUBLIC_IP> version`), you need to make sure the **1234** port is open.

### Why does my API server listening on `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001` when I invoke IPFS Daemon when fetching an IPFS Multiaddress?

Bacalhau communicates with IPFS via it's API port and not the swarm port which is why it's **5001** and not **4001**.

The key thing is whether the IPFS node is running on the same host as the bacalhau daemon. If it is, then **127.0.0.1** is enough to route traffic between the two (because they are both on the same node). If IPFS is running on a different node than bacalhau, then we need to replace **127.0.0.1** with the IP that the IPFS server is running on.

### What to do when i get error connection refused when running Bacalhau API ?

#### Problem
When running `bacalhau --api-host <MY_NODE_PUBLIC_IP> version`  and you get this error message: 

```
Error running version: publicapi: after posting request: Post "http://127.0.0.1:1234/version": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:1234: connect: connection refused
```

#### What to do
First, you'll need to check that the bacalhau server is up and running on the same host then it should be connecting using `127.0.0.1`. This can be checked by running `telnet 127.0.0.1 1234`. If telnet is not connecting to 127.0.0.1 1234 on the machine that bacalhau is running then one of 3 things:

- Bacalhau is running on a different machine
- it's running on a different port
- it's not running

### Can I run Bacalhau in a containerized setup (nested containers)?

We don't support this as it will result in the classic Dind(Docker In Docker) Problem.
