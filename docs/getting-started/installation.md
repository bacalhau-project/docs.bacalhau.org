# Getting Started with the Public Bacalhau Network

## Dependencies
* Install the bacalhau CLI

```
curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash
```
* Download and install (or update) [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Run a "hello world" job

```
bacalhau docker run ubuntu echo hello
```
// Explain here what this command is doing. What is INF jsonrpc/jsonrpc_client.go:73. I assume it's a program that prints out 'Hello'?
```
[2207] INF jsonrpc/jsonrpc_client.go:73 > Submitted Job Id: fa11069f-17e0-47de-b8b5-37444cb396b5
fa11069f-17e0-47de-b8b5-37444cb396b5
```
Copy the first part of the job id, such as `fa11069f`, we'll use it in a moment.


```
bacalhau list --wide --sort-by=id --id-filter=<JOB_ID>
```

Replace `JOB_ID` with the job id you copied in the last step.

Only one of the production servers accepted the job, because you only requested a concurrency setting of 1 (the default in `bacalhau docker run`).

You should see something like
// aren't these process IDs? It's confusing to have JOB_ID in two contexts
```
 fa11069f   QmdZQ7Zb  bid_rejected  /ipfs/
            QmXaXu9N  complete      /ipfs/QmQtZKRPXehLU5JroBbzBCVdhNkgZT7m4MiSD7sUVxE3LD
            QmYgxZiy  bid_rejected  /ipfs/
```

Copy the JOB_ID (in this case `fa11069f`), and run:
// More context here. What's happening?
```
bacalhau get JOB_ID
```

You should see the following:

```
[2207] INF bacalhau/get.go:35 > Fetching results of job 'fa11069f'...
[...]
[2207] INF ipfs/downloader.go:101 > Copying output volume outputs
```

Now read the stdout
// What is a stdout?
```
cat stdout
```

```
hello
```

Hooray, you have just run a job on the Bacalhau network!
