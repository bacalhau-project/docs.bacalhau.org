# Development

You can run a stand-alone Bacalhau and IPFS network on your computer with the following guide.

The most efficient way to spin up Bacalhau and run a fully local demo is to use the `devstack` command. Please see [Running Locally](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/blob/main/docs/running_locally.md) for instructions.
