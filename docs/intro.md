# The Bacalhau Project

Bacalhau is a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload. The architecture we use is also referred to as Compute Over Data (or CoD). Why the name? *[Bacalhau](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&text=bacalhau&op=translate)* is the Portuguese word for **Cod**! At the moment we are free volunteer network, enjoy;) 

In this documentation you will find:

- An introduction of the [main concepts](about-bacalhau/introduction.md) and its purpose.
- The project and [architecture overview](about-bacalhau/architecture.md).
- A [short guide](getting-started/installation.md) to help install and start using the CLI.
- Preloaded exciting [examples](examples/index.md) to showcase Bacalhau abilities and help get you started.
