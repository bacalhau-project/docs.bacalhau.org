## Introduction

This example will walk you through building Time Series Forecasting using [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet).

Prophet is a forecasting procedure implemented in R and Python. It is fast and provides completely automated forecasts that can be tuned by hand by data scientists and analysts.

### TL;DR

```bash
bacalhau docker run -v QmY8BAftd48wWRYDf5XnZGkhwqgjpzjyUG3hN1se6SYaFt:/example_wp_log_R.csv ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/r-prophet:0.0.2 -- Rscript Saturating-Forecasts.R "/example_wp_log_R.csv" "/outputs/output0.pdf" "/outputs/output1.pdf"
```

## Prerequisites

* A working R environment
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Bacalhau](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)

## 1. Running Prophet in R Locally

Open R studio or R supported IDE. If you want to run this on a notebook server, then make sure you use an R kernel.

Prophet is a CRAN package so you can use install.packages to install the prophet package.


```bash
R -e "install.packages('prophet',dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
```


After installation is finished, you can download the example data that is stored in IPFS.


```bash
wget https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmZiwZz7fXAvQANKYnt7ya838VPpj4agJt5EDvRYp3Deeo/example_wp_log_R.csv
```

The code below instantiates the library and fits a model to the data.


```bash
mkdir -p outputs
mkdir -p R
```


```python
%%writefile Saturating-Forecasts.R
library('prophet')

args = commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)
args

input = args[1]
output = args[2]
output1 = args[3]


I <- paste("", input, sep ="")

O <- paste("", output, sep ="")

O1 <- paste("", output1 ,sep ="")


df <- read.csv(I)

df$cap <- 8.5
m <- prophet(df, growth = 'logistic')

future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 1826)
future$cap <- 8.5
fcst <- predict(m, future)
pdf(O)
plot(m, fcst)
dev.off()

df$y <- 10 - df$y
df$cap <- 6
df$floor <- 1.5
future$cap <- 6
future$floor <- 1.5
m <- prophet(df, growth = 'logistic')
fcst <- predict(m, future)
pdf(O1)
plot(m, fcst)
dev.off()
```

    Writing Saturating-Forecasts.R



```bash
Rscript Saturating-Forecasts.R "example_wp_log_R.csv" "outputs/output0.pdf" "outputs/output1.pdf"
```

## 2. Running R Prophet on Bacalhau

To use Bacalhau, you need to package your code in an appropriate format. The developers have already pushed a container for you to use, but if you want to build your own, you can follow the steps below. You can view a [dedicated container example](../custom-containers/index.md) in the documentation.

### Dockerfile

In this step, you will create a `Dockerfile` to create an image. The `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains the commands used to assemble the image. First, create the `Dockerfile`.

```
FROM r-base
RUN R -e "install.packages('prophet',dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')"
RUN mkdir /R
RUN mkdir /outputs
COPY Saturating-Forecasts.R R
WORKDIR /R
```

Next, add your desired configuration to the `Dockerfile`. These commands specify how the image will be built, and what extra requirements will be included. We use r-base as the base image, and then install the prophet package. We then copy the R script into the container and set the working directory to the R folder.

We've already pushed this image to GHCR, but for posterity, you'd use a command like this to update it:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/r-prophet:0.0.1 .
```

After you have built the container successfully, the next step is to test it locally and then push it docker hub

### Fitting a Prophet Model on Bacalhau

[Bacalhau](https://www.bacalhau.org/) is a distributed computing platform that allows you to run jobs on a network of computers. It is designed to be easy to use and to run on a variety of hardware. In this example, we will use it to run the Prophet library to generate a model on a CPU.

To submit a job, you can use the Bacalhau CLI. The following command passes a prompt to the model and generates the results in the outputs directory. It takes approximately 2 minutes to run.


```bash
bacalhau docker run \
    --wait \
    --id-only \
    -v QmY8BAftd48wWRYDf5XnZGkhwqgjpzjyUG3hN1se6SYaFt:/example_wp_log_R.csv \
    ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/examples/r-prophet:0.0.2 \
    -- Rscript Saturating-Forecasts.R "/example_wp_log_R.csv" "/outputs/output0.pdf" "/outputs/output1.pdf"
```

Running the commands will output a UUID that represents the job that was created. You can check the status of the job with the following command:


```bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

    [92;100m CREATED  [0m[92;100m ID       [0m[92;100m JOB                     [0m[92;100m STATE     [0m[92;100m VERIFIED [0m[92;100m PUBLISHED               [0m

Where it says "`Completed `", that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

To find out more information about your job, run the following command:


```bash

```bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```
