# Running Pandas on Bacalhau

### Introduction

Pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

### Prerequisites

* Python
* The Bacalhau client - [Installation instructions](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)


## 1. Getting Started with Pandas Locally

The goal of this section is to show you how to develop a script to perform a task. We will then place this script in a container and run it at scale on Bacalhau. But first, you will need to install the Pandas library from pip.


```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Importing data from CSV to DataFrame

Pandas is built around the idea of a DataFrame, a container for representing data. Below you will create a DataFrame by importing a CSV file. A CSV file is a text file with one record of data per line. The values within the record are separated using the ‚Äúcomma‚Äù character. Pandas provides a useful method, named `read_csv()` to read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame. For example, we can create a file named `transactions.csv` containing details of Transactions. The CSV file is stored in the same directory that contains Python script.



```python
%%writefile read_csv.py
import pandas as pd

print(pd.read_csv("transactions.csv"))
```


```bash
# Downloading the dataset
wget https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmfKJT13h5k1b23ja3ZCVg5nFL9oKz2bVXc8oXgtwiwhjz/transactions.csv
```


```bash
cat transactions.csv
```

### Running the script

Now let's run the script to read in the CSV file. The output will be a DataFrame object.


```bash
python3 read_csv.py
```

                                                    hash  ...  transaction_type
    0  0x04cbcb236043d8fb7839e07bbc7f5eed692fb2ca55d8...  ...                 0

## 2. Running Pandas Jobs At Scale on Bacalhau

To run pandas on Bacalhau you must store your assets in a location that Bacalhau has access to. We usually default to storing data on IPFS and code in a container, but you can also easily upload your script to IPFS too.

If you are interested in finding out more about how to ingest your data into IPFS, please see the [data ingestion guide](../../data-ingestion/index.md).

We've already uploaded the script and data to IPFS to the following CID: `QmfKJT13h5k1b23ja3ZCVg5nFL9oKz2bVXc8oXgtwiwhjz`. You can look at this by browsing to one of the HTTP IPFS proxies like [ipfs.io](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmfKJT13h5k1b23ja3ZCVg5nFL9oKz2bVXc8oXgtwiwhjz/) or [w3s.link](https://bafybeih4hyydvojazlyv5zseelgn5u67iq2wbrbk2q4xoiw2d3cacdmzlu.ipfs.w3s.link/).

### Run the Job

Now we're ready to run a Bacalhau job, whilst mounting the Pandas script and data from IPFS. We'll use the `bacalhau docker run` command to do this. The `-v` flag allows us to mount a file or directory from IPFS into the container. The `-v` flag takes two arguments, the first is the IPFS CID and the second is the path to the directory in the container. The `-v` flag can be used multiple times to mount multiple directories.


```bash
 bacalhau docker run \
--wait \
--id-only \
-v QmfKJT13h5k1b23ja3ZCVg5nFL9oKz2bVXc8oXgtwiwhjz:/files \
-w /files \
amancevice/pandas \
-- python read_csv.py
```

Running the commands will output a UUID (like `e6377c99-b637-4661-a334-6ce98fcf037c`). This is the ID of the job that was created. You can check the status of the job with the following command:




```bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

    [92;100m CREATED  [0m[92;100m ID       [0m[92;100m JOB                     [0m[92;100m STATE     [0m[92;100m VERIFIED [0m[92;100m PUBLISHED               [0m
    [97;40m 13:38:11 [0m[97;40m d48079d4 [0m[97;40m Docker amancevice/pa... [0m[97;40m Completed [0m[97;40m          [0m[97;40m /ipfs/QmY2MEETWyX77B... [0m



Where it says "`Published`", that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

If there is an error you can view the error using the following command bacalhau describe


```bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

The describe command will display the logs and error messages from your job. There's no errors this time (lucky?) so now let's create a temporary directory to save our results.


```bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
```

To Download the results of your job, run the following command:


```bash
bacalhau get ${JOB_ID}  --output-dir results
```

    Fetching results of job 'd48079d4-1358-4ce1-8a9e-5b9e6ae40bda'...
    Results for job 'd48079d4-1358-4ce1-8a9e-5b9e6ae40bda' have been written to...
    results


After the download has finished you should 
see the following contents in pandas-results directory


```bash
ls results/combined_results/
```

    outputs
    stderr
    stdout


The structure of the files and directories will look like this:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combined_results
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stderr

        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stdout
```

* `stdout` contains things printed to the console like outputs, etc.

* `stderr` contains any errors. In this case, since there are no errors, it's will be empty

* `outputs` folder is the volume you named when you started the job with the `-o` flag. In addition, you will always have a `outputs` volume, which is provided by default.

Because your script is printed to stdout, the output will appear in the stdout file. You can read this by typing the following command:





```bash
cat results/combined_results/stdout
```

                                                    hash  ...  transaction_type

Success! The next step is to scale up your data and your processing via multiple jobs or sharding. You might be interested in looking at:
