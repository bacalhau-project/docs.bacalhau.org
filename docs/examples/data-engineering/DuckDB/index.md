## Introduction
DuckDB is a relational table-oriented database management system and supports SQL queries for producing analytical results. It also comes with various features that are useful for data analytics.

DuckDB is suited for the following use cases

Processing and storing tabular datasets, e.g. from CSV or Parquet files
Interactive data analysis, e.g. Joining & aggregate multiple large tables
Concurrent large changes, to multiple large tables, e.g. appending rows, adding/removing/updating columns
Large result set transfer to client

The advantage of using DuckDB with bacalhau is that you don’t need to install 
It locally also there is no need to download the datasets since the datasets are
Already there on IPFS or on the web


## Building Docker container

You can skip to running on bacalhau if you don’t want to build the container
If you want any additional dependencies to be installed along with DuckDB
you need to build your own container

To build your own docker container, create a Dockerfile, which contains 
Instructions to build your DuckDB   docker container


```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/python:3.9

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm g++

# Install dbt
RUN pip3 --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir install duckdb==0.4.0 dbt-duckdb==1.1.4 \
    && rm -rf /tmp/pip-tmp

# Install duckdb cli
RUN wget https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v0.4.0/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip \
    && unzip duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin \
    && rm duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip

# Configure Workspace
ENV DBT_PROFILES_DIR=/workspaces/datadex
WORKDIR /workspaces/datadex

```

Building the container
```
docker build -t davidgasquez/datadex:v0.2.0 .
```

Testing it locally
```
❯ docker run davidgasquez/datadex:v0.1.0 "select 1"
┌───┐
│ 1 │

```


Since our container is working locally we push it to docker hub
```
docker push davidgasquez/datadex:v0.2.0
```






## Running on bacalhau



```python
!curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash
```

    Your system is linux_amd64
    No BACALHAU detected. Installing fresh BACALHAU CLI...
    Getting the latest BACALHAU CLI...

To test whether the same command that we ran locally runs on bacalhau we run the following command


```bash
bacalhau docker run \
     --workdir /inputs/ \
     --wait \
     --id-only \
     davidgasquez/datadex:v0.2.0 -- /bin/bash -c 'duckdb -s "select 1"'
```


```python
%env JOB_ID={job_id}
```

    env: JOB_ID=eb72c5f5-599b-464e-af93-3ecb9247e9af



```bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID}
```

Where it says "Completed", that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

To find out more information about your job, run the following command:



```bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

```bash
