## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will first scrape all the links from a public AWS S3 buckets and then copy the data to IPFS using Bacalhau. 

## Getting the URLs from AWS S3 bucket

- Install [Bacalhau](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation/). 
- If your bucket has more than 1000 files, with the command below you can submit a Bacalhau job to extract the URL list of the files.

```bash
bacalhau docker run \
-u https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/ \
-v QmR1qXs8Y8T7G6F2Yy91sDTWG6WAhoFrCjMGRvy7N1y5LC:/extract.py \
--id-only \
--wait \
python \
-- /bin/bash -c 'python3 extract.py https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/  /inputs'
```

- Before running the command below, replace the following:

    - `-u  https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/`: we replace the placeholders with `noaa-goes16` which is the name of the bucket we want to extract URLs from

    - `-v QmR1qXs8Y8T7G6F2Yy91sDTWG6WAhoFrCjMGRvy7N1y5LC:/extract.py \`: Mounting the scrapper script, this script extracts the links from the XML document tree

    - `-- /bin/bash -c 'python3 extract.py https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/  /inputs'`: Executing the scrapper script

Since the script extracts the path of the file in the bucket, we need to add the URL as a prefix to the path `https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/`  then provide the path where the XML document tree of the URL is mounted which is `/inputs`

:::note
There are certain limitations to this step, as this only works with datasets that are publicly accessible and don't require an AWS account or pay to use buckets and possibly only limited to first 1000 URLs.

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job with the following command:

```bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID} --wide
```

When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: To find out more information about your job, run the following command:

```bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```
- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using bacalhau get. You can also choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory

```bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results
```

After the download has finished you should see the following contents in results directory.

## Viewing your Job Output

Each job creates 3 subfolders: the **combined_results**,****per_shard files**, and the **raw** directory.

In each of these sub_folders, you'll find the **studout** and **stderr** file.

To view the file in the stdout folder, run the following command:

```bash
head -10 results/combined_results/stdout
```

## Copying the Data from AWS S3 to IPFS

From the output of the job we ran above, we have the links that we want, next is to save them to IPFS using Bacalhau.

Selecting the first ten links

```bash
head -10 results/combined_results/stdout > links.txt
```

Selecting all the links

```
cat results/combined_results/stdout > links.txt
```

Creating a script to submit jobs


```python
%%writefile move.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
while read URL; do
  bacalhau docker run --input-urls="${URL}" \
  --id-only \
  --wait \
  docker.io/bacalhauproject/uploader:v0.9.14
done < links.txt
```

    Overwriting move.sh


Running the script


```bash
bash move.sh
```

```
</details>

### List Job Outputs in JSON format

In this case, we will move the first 10 URLs and set the no of jobs to 10 `-n 10`. If you have submitted the whole list you can set `-n` to 1000


```bash
bacalhau list -n 10 --output json > output.json
```

Installing `jq` to extract CID from the results


```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq
```

Extracting the CIDs from output json


```bash
jq '.[] ."JobState" ."Nodes"' output.json > output-shards.json
jq '.[]."Shards"."0"."PublishedResults"."CID" | select( . != null )'  output-shards.json
```
