In this tutorial, to copy Data from S3 to IPFS, we will scrape all the links from a public AWS S3 buckets and then copy the data to IPFS using Bacalhau.


## Prerequisite

To get started, you need to install the Bacalhau client, see more information [here](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation)

## Running a Bacalhau Job

If your bucket has more than 1000 files, with the command below, you can submit a Bacalhau job to extract the URL list of the files.


```bash
%%bash --out job_id
bacalhau docker run \
-u https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/ \
-v QmR1qXs8Y8T7G6F2Yy91sDTWG6WAhoFrCjMGRvy7N1y5LC:/extract.py \
--id-only \
--wait \
python \
-- /bin/bash -c 'python3 extract.py https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/  /inputs'
```


### Structure of the Command

Let's look closely at the command above:

- `bacalhau docker run`: call to bacalhau

- `-u  https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/`: the name of the bucket we want to extract URLs from. Repeplace the placeholders with `noaa-goes16` which your own name.

-  `-v QmR1qXs8Y8T7G6F2Yy91sDTWG6WAhoFrCjMGRvy7N1y5LC:/extract.py \`: Mounting the scrapper script CID, this script extracts the links from the XML document tree

- `-- /bin/bash -c 'python3 extract.py https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/  /inputs'`: Executing the scrapper script path to input dataset


The command above extracts the path of the file in the bucket, we added the URL as a prefix to the path `https://noaa-goes16.s3.amazonaws.com/`  then provided the path where the XML document tree of the URL is mounted which is `/inputs`


When a job is sumbitted, Bacalhau prints out the related `job_id`. We store that in an environment variable so that we can reuse it later on.

:::tip
This only works with datasets that are publicly accessible and don't require an AWS account or pay to use buckets and possibly only limited to first 1000 URLs.

## Checking the State of your Jobs

- **Job status**: You can check the status of the job using `bacalhau list`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list --id-filter ${JOB_ID} --wide
```

When it says `Published` or `Completed`, that means the job is done, and we can get the results.

- **Job information**: You can find out more information about your job by using `bacalhau describe`.


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau describe ${JOB_ID}
```

- **Job download**: You can download your job results directly by using `bacalhau get`. Alternatively, you can choose to create a directory to store your results. In the command below, we created a directory and downloaded our job output to be stored in that directory.


```bash
%%bash
rm -rf results && mkdir -p results # Temporary directory to store the results
bacalhau get $JOB_ID --output-dir results # Download the results
```

After the download has finished you should see the following contents in results directory.

## Viewing your Job Output

Each job creates 3 subfolders: the **combined_results**, **per_shard files**, and the **raw** directory. To view your file, run the following command:


```bash
%%bash
head -10 results/combined_results/stdout
```

### Extracting Links from Job Output

From the output of the job we ran above, we extracted the links that we want.next is to save them to IPFS using Bacalhau.

Selecting the first ten links


```bash
%%bash
head -10 results/combined_results/stdout > links.txt
```

Selecting all the links

```
cat results/combined_results/stdout > links.txt
```

Creating a script to submit jobs


```python
%%writefile move.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
while read URL; do
  bacalhau docker run --input-urls="${URL}" \
  --id-only \
  --wait \
  docker.io/bacalhauproject/uploader:v0.9.14
done < links.txt
```

Running the script


```bash
%%bash
bash move.sh
```

    9c1acb25-6fec-4d14-a91a-4a1f60f985b9


### List the Outputs of the Jobs in JSON Format

In this case, we will move the first 10 URLs and set the no of jobs to 10 `-n 10`. If you have submitted the whole list you can set `-n` to 1000


```bash
%%bash
bacalhau list -n 10 --output json > output.json
```

Installing jq to extract CID from the results


```bash
%%bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq
```

Extracting the CIDs from output json


```bash
%%bash
jq '.[] ."JobState" ."Nodes"' output.json > output-shards.json
jq '.[]."Shards"."0"."PublishedResults"."CID" | select( . != null )'  output-shards.json
```
